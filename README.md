# yiffhub-core
This is a repository containing the entire working backend system of Yiffhub

I created this repo to backup important data and code from the server for use in other personal uses alongside creating redundancy in the event of a bot or server shutdown.

Considering much of the base system code is adapted from existing code for specific use on YiffHub I do not plan on making this resource public in any way out of respect for the original creators!

Hopefully this helps with the creation of your own server!
